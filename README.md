# Shewey Realty

A webpack installation of shewey realty website using React

## Getting Started

This implementation uses Webpack and React.

### Prerequisites

Install npm using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```
brew install node
```

### Setup

```
cd webpck-sheweyrealty
npm install
```

### Overwiew

You have two main options, one that can bundle the application into a lightweight setup, another that is used for running the development server.

## Build the App

Building the application compiles the css, javascript, and image files into the dist folder for a distribution that can work on Apache servers.

```
npm run build
```

## Development Server

To make some changes you can start the development server which will compile files as well, but no hot reloading for dev purposes has been incorportated yet :(

```
npm run dev
```

wait...

It should be hosted on localhost:8080
